# Session: 2026-02-19

Duration: ~0.5h  
Milestone: Protocol login flow stabilization

- [x] Visible result achieved?
- [x] Tests written/passing?
- [x] Journal updated?
- [x] Next session's first task clear?

## What I did
- Identified and fixed a protocol discrepancy between Moongate v1 and v2 during login/reconnect.
- Root cause: compression was not enabled at the same stage as v1, so client/server packet stream diverged after redirect/login.
- Updated packet flow so outbound sequence and compression state match expected UO client behavior.

## What's next
- Re-check full login -> character list -> world enter path with packet logs enabled.
- Add/extend integration coverage for reconnect + compression-enabled transitions.

## Blockers
- None.
